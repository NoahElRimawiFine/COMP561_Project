# COMP561 Project

# 4 datasets:
# chromFa (human genome)
# wgEncodingRegTfbs...GM12878 (genomic regions which are active regulatory regions in cell GM12878)
# factorbookMotifPos (genome coordinates for actual transcription factor binding sites for different transcription factors)
# factorbookMotifPwm (position weight matrices for each transcription factor)

# download all 4 datasets, put them in the 'datasets' folder and unzip them.
